## Assignments

Markdowns are just a way to lay out a page like html or pdf, word etc... R however has a good feature linked in with RStudio called R markdown that allows you to display your code in much prettier / easier to read ways ! I added links to the html output from the markdown files below. 

#### Rendered markdowns Assignment 2
- [Question 2](https://rawgit.com/Addyvan/Statistical-Learning/blob/master/A2Q2.html)
- [Question 3](https://rawgit.com/Addyvan/Statistical-Learning/blob/master/A2Q3.html)
- [Question 4](https://rawgit.com/Addyvan/Statistical-Learning/blob/master/A2Q4.html)
